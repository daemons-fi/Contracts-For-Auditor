/**
 * @title DAEM Vesting Contract
 * @dev Contract used to linearly vest tokens for multiple beneficiaries.
 * How to use:
 * Step 1: deploy the contract, a start date and a duration
 * Step 2: transfer the total amount of tokens to be vested to the Vesting contract
 * Step 3: Define beneficiaries and relative amounts they are due
 *
 * If after the start date some tokens are unassigned, the owner can claim them back
 * Anyone can release the due amount, by calling the release function and specifying the beneficiary address
